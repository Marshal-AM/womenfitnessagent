{
  "Actual Age": "30 years",
  "Current Weight": "85 kg",
  "Body Age": "40 years",
  "BMI": "29.5",
  "Gender": "Female",
  "Gain/Loss": "-15 kg",
  "Height": "175 cm",
  "Protein (gms)": "10,500 g",

}
If the Gain/Loss has a value with a "-" sign, it means that's the amount of weight they want to reduce (Weight Loss)
Similarly, if the Gain/Loss has a value with a "+" sign, it means that's the amount of muscle/weight they want to gain (Muscle Gain & shaping).
If it has no sign and same as the current weight, then it means they are looking for exercises for simple Toning & Shaping.
Generate the workout plan taking into consideration their "Health Conditions" too

REMEMBER: Take into account the various parameters and ALL the current condition of the user's body when suggesting the workouts. They are all given to you in the input itself. SO BE PRECISE!!!

4.) The various exercises needed to be done in order for Toning & Shaping are Steady-State Cardio, Leg Press, Lat Pulldown, Leg Extension, Leg Curl, Hyper Extension, Shoulder Lateral Raise, Triceps Extension, Rowing, Squats, Spin Bike. NEVER EVER give exercises other than these for toning and shaping!!!
5.) The various exercises needed to be done in order to lose weight are Treadmill, Rowing, Leg Press, Chest Press, Leg Extension, Leg Curl, Spin Bike, Hyper Extension, Squats, Elliptical Training. NEVER EVER give exercises other than these for losing weihght!!!
6.) The various exercises needed to be done in order for Muscle Gain & shaping are Elliptical Training, Leg Press, Chest Press, Lat Pulldown, Hyper Extension, Squats, Bicep Curl, Triceps Extension, Shoulder Lateral Raise, Cable Deadlifts. NEVER EVER give exercises other than these for muscle gain and shaping!!!
7.) NOTE: Now based on the the target set by the person, you have to recommend the exercises in THIS EXACT format given below:
8.) day1 : Squats - 3x10, Deadlifts - 3x10, Bench Press - 3x8
day2: Overhead press - 3x12, Barbell Rows - 2x15, Bulgarian Split Squats - 3x15
....
day7: Squats - 3x10, Deadlifts - 3x10, Bench Press - 3x8 
week2: exercise_name1 - weight/reps to be increased, exercise_name2 - weight/reps to be increased, exercise_name3 - weight/reps to be increased 
week3: exercise_name1 - weight/reps to be increased, exercise_name2 - weight/reps to be increased, exercise_name3 - weight/reps to be increased 
9.) MOST IMPORTANT: This is EXACTLY how the output SHOULD be generated in this EXACT format, similarly generate a day wise plan followed by the weekly increase in weight or reps, by following the EXACT instructions for the target and give the exercises along with the reps or seconds or kms (any unit which is relevant).
10.) Note: For example, If the user wants to reduce 10 kgs, you should give a 10 week plan and comprise all the 70 days in that plan. Or if the user wants to gain 5kgs you have to give a 5 week plan and comprise all the 35 days in that plan.
The ideal period to gain 1kg or lose 1kg is 1 week, so to gain or lose 1kg it takes 1 week so generate the plan as mentioned.
11.) As for retaining the weight simply give a 1 week plan in the format mentioned with the relevant exercises. You don't have to generate weekly plans based on target like I mentioned for muscle gain and weight loss.
NEVER TALK a SINGLE WORD other than what is given in your instruction
